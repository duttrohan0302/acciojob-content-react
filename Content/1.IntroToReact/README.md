# React

- It is a javascript library
- It uses something called JSX (HTML+JS)
- It is used to build single page applications using something known as virtual DOM
- What is create-react-app?
- It is a tool provided by React org to help beginners easily setup and run react applications.

## To create a react application
- Go to a folder where you want to create a new react application and run the command
    <pre>
    npx create-react-app app_name
    </pre>

## Files generated by create-react-app
1. README.md
    - Mentions the commands and future scope
2. package.json 
    - Dependencies
        - React - The main react package
        - React DOM - The document object model
        - React Scripts - The commands which run the application
    - Scripts - To run the react application
        - start - Runs the application and shows the output in the browser (http://localhost:3000/)
        - build - To build the application for production (deployment)
        - test - Runs all the test files in the directory
        - eject - If you're not happy with the configuration given by create-react-app and want to go out, once out you can't come back
3. package-lock.json
    - Contains further details and codebase link of each dependency module & it's further dependencies
4. node_modules
    - The code behind every dependency, big folder with lots of files, we don't have to push it to git/heroku/netlify anywhere ever
    - If you ever don't have node_modules folder in your react app, the app won't run
    - To get the folder, just enter the following command
    <pre>
    npm install
    </pre>
    - It will automatically install all packages mentioned in package.json file
5. .gitignore
    - Contains the list of files you don't have to push to github ever
    - Whenever you want, you can generate them
    - Make sure you have /node_modules & /build in your .gitignore file
6. public folder
    - Mainly all files are insignificant, just logos
    - index.html
        - Main file & the only html file
        - There is a div with id as root, our react application renders all our code inside that div
        - Usually we don't write any code in index.html
        - Only css files, bootstrap cdns, font-awesome cdns, google fonts apis are linked in the header
7. src folder
    - setupTests.js 
        - Basic test set up
    - reportWebVitals.js
        - Uses the web vitals package
    - logo.svg
        - Some logo, the boilerplate application is using, similar to putting an image in a html file
    - index.js
        - Uses concepts similar in JS to render our code inside the div having the id "root"
        - Renders the code inside App component
    - index.css
        - Just common css styling for the application
    - App.css
        - CSS styling for code written in App.js
        - So it's the css for html code written in javascript file
        - But how can we write HTML code in JavaScript file
    - App.test.js
        - Tests for App.js file (Frontend testing)
    - App.js
        - Contains the code which is being rendered
        - The code looks similar to Javascript with HTML embedded in it
        - This is known as JSX
    - Every component has the following structure
        - Name of the component file starts with a capital letter
        - The component file has a function or a class (why function/class) with the same name usually as the filename
        - Few import statements in the top which includes the packages, or the css files, or the images, or other components which are going to be used in this component
        - Finally in the end we have a export default statement

## Similarities or differences between HTML,CSS vs JSX
- class in HTML is known as className in React as class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript
- All tags must be closing tags, for img, br, hr we can use auto closing `<br />`
- In labels, instead of for, we write htmlFor, as for is a reserved keyword in JavaScript
- For inline styling, write style={{write key value pairs here}}
- Remember, style names are all camel case here, e.g. background-color in css becomes backgroundColor in JSX

## Things to remember
- React app created using create-react-app has auto-reload feature, just save and it will be reloaded (similar to live server extension in VS Code)
- If you have to write JavaScript inside HTML, use `{` anything you write inside this will be treated as javaScript expression`}`
- Any errors that are present can be seen on the terminal where react app is running or on the console in browser and sometimes on the browser page itself
- Inside the return statement, there must be only 1 parent HTML tag
